take whatever flat damage shows up for your special and proceed per the above. Ares can be nice on attack, but maybe wait until you see the first hammer, because if you can get Charged Shot, Iâ€™d prefer a percentage boost like Aphrodite. 

### Merciful End
```
Keepsake 1: Blood-filled Vial (Ares)
Keepsake 2: Owl Pendant (Athena)

Attack: Curse of Agony (Ares)
Special: Divine Flourish (Athena)
Dash: Divine Dash (Athena)
Duo: Merciful End (Ares + Athena)
```

You can put Ares on either attack or special, but lean attack so you can switch to dash-strikes if you get the duo and Divine Dash.

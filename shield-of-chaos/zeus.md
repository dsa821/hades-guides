## Builds

### Zeus Stack
```
Keepsake 1: Thunder Signet (Zeus)

Special: Thunder Flourish (Zeus)

Support:
  Static Discharge (Zeus)
  Double Strike (Zeus)
  High Voltage (Zeus)
```
Scale up with poms, more Zeus, Pressure Points & Hunter’s Mark, or whatever you can manage to do with your attack while the shield is out.

### Merciful End
```
Keepsake 1: Owl Pendant (Athena)
Keepsake 2: Blood-filled Vial (Ares)

Special: Divine Flourish (Athena)
Attack: Curse of Agony (Ares)
Duo:
  Merciful End (Ares + Athena)
  Deadly Reversal (Artemis + Athena)
```
Because you can attack and special simultaneously, you don’t need Divine Dash for fast damage, and it doesn’t matter where Ares is on attack or special; take the highest rarity on offer.

Special: Drunken Flourish (Dionysus)
Support:
  Bad Influence (Dionysus)
  Numbing Sensation (Dionysus)

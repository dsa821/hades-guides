## Builds

### Poseidon Cast
```
Keepsake 1: Conch Shell (Poseidon)
Keepsake 2: Adamant Arrowhead (Artemis)

Cast: Flood Flare (Poseidon)
Attack: Deadly Strike (Artemis)
Duo: Mirage Shot (Artemis + Poseidon)
Support:
  Snow Burst (Demeter)
  Wave Pounding (Poseidon)
  Fully Loaded (Artemis)
```
Pom the cast aggressively. Don’t get Breaking Wave or Typhoon’s Fury if you don’t yet have Mirage Shot, because you don’t want to unlock Second Wave. Flood Flare doesn’t trigger Sea Storm, so don’t chase that.

### Aphrodite Cast
```
Keepsake 1: Eternal Rose (Aphrodite)

Cast: Passion Flare (Aphrodite)
Support:
  Snow Burst (Demeter)
  Ravenous Will (Demeter)
  
Attack: Deadly Strike (Artemis)
Dash: Tidal Dash (Poseidon)
Duo: Mirage Shot (Artemis + Poseidon)
```
Pom the cast aggressively. Also valid is putting Athena on attack, slotting Artemis somewhere, and going for Deadly Reversal so the casts can crit.

### Dionysus Cast
```
Mirror: Stygian Soul
Keepsake 1: Overflowing Cup (Dionysus)

Cast: Trippy Flare (Dionysus)
Attack: Deadly Strike (Artemis)
Dash: Tidal Dash (Poseidon)
Duo: Mirage Shot (Artemis + Poseidon)
```
Fully Loaded, Chaos, and Prometheus Stones for more casts make this insanely good.

## Builds

### Artemis Attack
```
Keepsake 1: Adamant Arrowhead (Artemis)
Keepsake 2: Eternal Rose (Aphrodite)

Attack: Deadly Strike (Artemis)
Special: Heartbreak Flourish (Aphrodite)

Duo: Heart Rend (Aphrodite + Artemis)
```
Aphrodite on dash or special will unlock Heart Rend and get you on your way to Smoldering Air. Dionysus on dash or call to unlock Splitting Headache is a solid take, too.

### Athena Attack
```
Keepsake 1: Owl Pendant (Athena)
Keepsake 2:
  Adamant Arrowhead (Artemis)
  Eternal Rose (Aphrodite)

Attack: Divine Strike (Athena)
Special: Deadly Flourish (Artemis)
Dash: Passion Dash (Aphrodite)
Support:
  Pressure Points (Artemis)
  Hunter's Mark (Artemis)
```

### Aphrodite Stack
```
Keepsake 1: Eternal Rose (Aphrodite)

Attack: Heartbreak Strike (Aphrodite)
```
If you get Exploding Launcher, put Artemis on special and go for Heart Rend.

### Poseidon Dash
```
Keepsake 1: Conch Shell (Poseidon)

Dash: Tidal Dash (Poseidon)
Support:
  Breaking Wave (Poseidon)
  Wave Pounding (Poseidon)
  Razor Shoals (Poseidon)
```
Any attack boon is decent or you might get an early Exploding Launcher and want to focus on special, so you can defer that decision until youâ€™ve seen the first hammer.

### Merciful End
```
Keepsake 1: Blood-filled Vial (Ares)
Keepsake 2: Owl Pendant (Athena)

Attack: Curse of Agony (Ares)
Special: Divine Flourish (Athena)
Dash: Divine Dash (Athena)
Duo: Merciful End (Ares + Athena)
```

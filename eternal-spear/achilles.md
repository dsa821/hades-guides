### Zeus Stack
```
Keepsake 1: Thunder Signet (Zeus)

```

### Dionysus Attack
```
Keepsake 1: Overflowing Cup (Dionysus)

Attack: Drunken Strike (Dionysus)
Special: Any other status
```
Rush through baddies for one status, backstab for privileged status, then oh you look you have 3 bloodstones and 3 buffed casts and literally any cast is a hoot with a 190% damage boost. If theyâ€™re not dead yet, stab away until the hangover and stabbing kills them and they cough up the bloodstones. Repeat.

### Flurry Jab (Hammer)
```
Keepsake 1: Conch Shell (Poseidon)
Keepsake 2:
  Adamant Arrowhead (Artemis)
  Thunder Signet (Zeus)
  
Hammer: Flurry Jab
Dash: Tidal Dash (Poseidon)
Attack:
  Deadly Strike (Artemis)
  Lightning Strike (Zeus)
```
Get a beefy cast like Phalanx Shot or flex for Hunting Blades if you have Artemis attack. Only stop dash-striking to special and refresh the buff or chuck a cast. Scale up with more Zeus, Artemis, Poseidon, Sea Storm, more dashes from Hermes, or Hyper Sprint + Rush Delivery.
